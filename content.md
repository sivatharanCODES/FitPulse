## About FitPulse

We are a technology company first, but with a major focus on consumer well-being through an active lifestyle. Most people are very busy with their jobs, family, and friends, and other important activities, which doesn’t leave much time for fitness and self-care. This might lead to low energy, poor health, and lasting consequences. We want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to set their fitness goals, preferred workouts, and available equipment, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly training plan. But we don’t stop there. We partner with top trainers and gyms to actually deliver real-time guided workouts and progress tracking, in selected cities. All this will be packaged in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between one or two personalized sessions per day, every single day of the month.

Your daily dose of fitness in 3 simple steps

Step 1 — Track and personalize your profile:
FitPulse starts by analyzing your fitness data to understand your body better. The app records your weight progress, percentage of exercise completed, blood hemoglobin (Hg) levels, and preferred workout types. You can select your favorite exercises or training styles, and FitPulse AI will build a personalized plan that fits your body and goals perfectly.

Step 2 — Monitor and schedule your activities:
FitPulse automatically tracks your daily activity schedule with detailed date logs and heart rate monitoring. You can view your progress on an interactive timeline, adjust training intensity, or even add new custom activities at any time. The app keeps your fitness journey organized and goal-driven every single day.

Step 3 — Train smart with live feedback:
Once you start your workout, FitPulse continuously monitors your performance in real time. You’ll receive instant feedback, posture corrections, and smart suggestions to help you improve form, endurance, and recovery. It’s like having a professional trainer watching and guiding you every step of the way.
